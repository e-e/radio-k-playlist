# Radio-K Youtube playlist
### Motivation
I think it was back in June of 2016 that I heard a certain song on the radio. After some searching, I eventually found it. Unfortunately I never wrote it down, and here I am unable to find it. So I created this to make it easier to go through the songs played on Radio K, in the hopes that I'll run accross this long-lost song.

### Setup
Rename the ```config.sample.js``` file to ```config.js```, and set the appropriate values. (You'll have to get a [YouTube Data API v3](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/overview?project=radio-k) api key)

```npm install``` and ```npm start``` and you should be good to go.
